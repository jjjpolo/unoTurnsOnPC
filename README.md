# Uno Turns On PC.
Helped with a servomotor and connecting the source to a smart-plug such as AmazonSmartPlug, Sonoff or Magic-home, on startup the microcontroller moves a servomotor to press the power button of a laptop. If there is no response (either a enabling a pin or IR signal)

## Software needed.
* Arduino IDE (latest version). 

## Hardware needed.
* This version in compatible with:
    - Arduino UNO
    - Arduino MEGA
    - Node MCU
    - ESP32
* Servomotor
* IR LED and IR transistor (as an option to detect when the PC is powered on).
